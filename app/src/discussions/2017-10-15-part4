Objective done: Import images from src
From official doc, seems the suggested way of dynamic source is importing from a file, then use the file directly.
Seems troublesome to me, as the advantages they raised (error when file not found, easier to compile) does not make a lot of sense for me.
Should keep an eye for the new public method, and compare it with my approach later.
