Objective done: Refactor maze reducer: Add levels controls

It's interesting that, if missing initial values, the app won't work at all.
Hardcoding initial values are of course bad practices, so we should put a loader page when the data is loading.
But seems that's later work

    Refactor number field
    Create character image instead of question mark
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Implement battle mechanics
    Investigate ES6 import issues. Currently, if one door is destroyed, all destroyed doors will suddenly animate again.

  Medium priority
    Tidy up codes
