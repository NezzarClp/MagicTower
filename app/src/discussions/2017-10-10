Objective done: Implemented sketch for SVG buttons. Imported the real floor.png
Investigated how svg works. Probably should write a parser/use html-to-react to add "onClick" to svg.

A good time to work on mechanics (therefore a branch). The master branch should now be used to keep "general" processes and features should be implemented on branches to avoid mutual restrictions.
