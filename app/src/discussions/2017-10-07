Objective done: Implemented initial movement checking for character.

I accepted the pull request by me, but seems it's risky to do the conflict checking on the website.
Perhaps I should commit a merge before that.
Also I should create a branch for UI designs, currently a lot of images are labelled '?'.

TODO:
  High priority
    Create SVG buttons for control panel
    Flatten the state content in maze reducer
    Fix the position of character image
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Create monsters in grid

  Medium priority
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Enlarge the grid
