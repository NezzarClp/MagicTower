Objective done: added x and y coordinate support for grid cell.

I choose to use absolute positioning for the cells. Seems it will be easier to handle overlapping images later then the approach of dividing grid to rows

Discussion: should I move everything belong to a cell to GridCell or should I create classes like MonsterCell, TileCell to handle the rendering of monsters and tiles?
Seems the former approach will allow easier control for cells. Properly go for that.

TODO:
  High priority
    Implement maze reducer to store the config of the maze
    Read maze from .json instead of hardcoding
    Implement the character position

  Medium priority
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Make the outer of character image transparent
