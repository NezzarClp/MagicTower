Objective done: Implemented more stylings for number fields
While the buttons are not done, I think I am going to switch back to mechanics.

TODO:
  High priority
    Fix the position of character image
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Implement battle mechanics

  Medium priority
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Enlarge the grid
    Tidy up README a bit

  Low priority
    Prepare to build minimized version of the app
