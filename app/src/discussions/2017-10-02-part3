Objective done: Created 3 more buttons to move character to each of the 4 cardinal directions

Seems flex-box is a powerful tool to position divs in css.

TODO:
  High priority
    Implement movement checking in reducer
    Flatten the state content in maze reducer
    Fix the position of character image
    Create monsters in grid

  Medium priority
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Make the outer of character image transparent
