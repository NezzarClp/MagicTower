Objective done: Implemented door image rendering

Spent lots of time investigating inline SVG. Probably will switch back to normal circle buttons
We can also choose to ignore that part for now and allow keyboard input only.

TODO:
  High priority
    Design stat panel
    Fix the position of character image
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Implement battle mechanics

  Medium priority
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Enlarge the grid
    Tidy up README a bit
    
  Low priority 
    Prepare to build minimized version of the app
