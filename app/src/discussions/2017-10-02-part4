Objective done: Refactor grid cell logic so that each grid cell listen to the state of itself only
and the grid knows nothing about the details of the grid cells.

Preparation to movement checking in reducer, should be done by tomorrow

Possibly a chance for me to learn branching and merging in git.

  High priority

    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?

    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
