Objective done: Added a button to move the `character` around. (Currently only left)
Done by refactoring part of the character cell implementation

Maybe we should flatten the structure of the state in maze reducer.
Ideally we should provide a list for Grid for the available cells,
then create cell containers to read the specific state of cell.
This way, when a cell changes content we don't need call render in Grid.react.js and re-render every cell.

Probably good time to implement a detailed control panel.
Also we need to implement the checking of movement, preventing character from moving out of the field / walls

TODO:
  High priority
    Implement movement checking in reducer 
    Flatten the state content in maze reducer
    Fix the position of character image
    Read maze from .json instead of hardcoding
    Create monsters in grid

  Medium priority
    Design the control panel, currently we should support four buttons, probably on the right?
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Make the outer of character image transparent
