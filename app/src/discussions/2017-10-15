Objective done: Simulating fight, and support displaying information of character
Refactored 1. maze reducer 2. monstersDetails.object

It shows that planning how the object will be used beforehand is quite important.
Moreover, we should use object whenever possible. Array indices can be nasty.
Should refactor doorsDetails as well when implementing removal of door.
Moreover, it's a good time to modify the format of maze.js to group properties of monsters of same type.
