Objective done: Refactor cells: Started Item Cells.

I planned to create a field `activateFunction`, a string, so that when the item is collected the function with the corresponding name is triggered.
Hopefully that can be done in 1 day.

TODO:

    Investigate ES6 import issues. Currently, if one door is destroyed, all destroyed doors will suddenly animate again.
    Implement item functions.

  Medium priority
    Refactor cells to use a common cell as upper class
    Update message box
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
