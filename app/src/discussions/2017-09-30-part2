Objective done: made grid hard-coded from reducer instead of component. Also tried to add a overlapping character image on top of one of the grid.

Perhaps good time to add monsters, and we should support moving character around? Should be a good time to add some actions

TODO:
  High priority
    Fix the position of character image
    Read maze from .json instead of hardcoding
    Create buttons to move character around
    Create monsters in grid

  Medium priority
    Create character png with transparent background
    Move all constants to constant files
    Move more types of tiles to codebase
    Make the outer of character image transparent
